Base: Use at LEAST Rails 5

Part One: Make a RESTful API for Owners and Pets
- owner
    - name
    - age
    - occupation
- pet
    - name
    - age
    - color
    - species

Owners can own multiple pets and pets can have multiple owners

- CRUD
- sort
- filter/search
- page

Part Three: Build a basic UI on top of this API
